# Patika.Dev_ReactNative
This GitHub repository contains the projects I developed for the React Native courses I took on Patika.Dev. I have created a separate folder for each project and provided the necessary steps to run the projects in the README file.
1.Project - Twitter Screen
  It was made to be an example of the FlatList structure.
